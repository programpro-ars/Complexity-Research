#### "Strong computational complexity estimates for selected Boolean functions and De-Morgan formulas" 


This paper presents strong estimates on the computational complexity and communication complexity of the game for some Boolean functions. All the blocks needed to create the final schemes were found by SAT solvers and tested using a Python program on all possible input combinations. The last section contains some of my ideas for improving the methods of searching for schemes with SAT solvers.
